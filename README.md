# **Scalable Big Data Pipeline for Sales and Customer Analysis**  

### **Overview**  
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a scalable big data pipeline to analyze sales and customer data (2015–2017). The pipeline leverages **Azure** and **AWS** technologies to process and transform raw data into actionable insights. It follows a **metalayered architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to ensure structured data processing and high-quality analytics.  

---

### **Features**  
- **Metalayered Architecture**:  
  - **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion and storage.  
  - **Silver Layer**: Data cleansing, transformation, and enrichment.  
  - **Gold Layer**: Aggregated and analytics-ready data.  

- **Data Ingestion**:  
  - Utilized **Azure Data Factory** for ETL workflows.  

- **Data Transformation**:  
  - Implemented data cleaning and feature engineering using **Azure Databricks**.  

- **Data Aggregation**:  
  - Aggregated data in **Azure Synapse Analytics** for efficient querying.  

- **Visualization**:  
  - Created interactive dashboards in **Amazon QuickSight** to visualize trends, customer behavior, and revenue performance.  

- **Security**:  
  - Ensured encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control (RBAC), and data masking to comply with GDPR.

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Azure Services**:  
  - Azure Data Factory  
  - Azure Data Lake Gen2  
  - Azure Databricks  
  - Azure Synapse Analytics  

- **AWS Services**:  
  - Amazon QuickSight  

- **Other Tools**:  
  - Apache Spark  
  - Python  
  - SQL  

---

### **Dataset**  
- **Source**: [Kaggle Sales and Customer Data (2015–2017)](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- **Description**: Dataset includes sales transactions, customer demographics, and revenue data over three years.  

---

### **How to Run the Project**  

#### Prerequisites  
1. Azure subscription with access to Data Factory, Data Lake, Databricks, and Synapse Analytics.  
2. AWS account for Amazon QuickSight.  
3. Python environment with required libraries (e.g., pandas, pyspark).  

#### Steps  
1. **Data Ingestion**:  
   - Use Azure Data Factory to create pipelines that ingest data into Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Bronze Layer).  

2. **Data Transformation**:  
   - Use Azure Databricks to clean and transform data and store it in the Silver Layer.  

3. **Data Aggregation**:  
   - Use Azure Synapse Analytics to aggregate data and save it in the Gold Layer.  

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Offload data locally and import it into Amazon QuickSight for dashboard creation.  

---

### **Expected Outcomes**  
- **Actionable Insights**:  
  - Sales trends, revenue growth, and customer behavior patterns.  
- **Improved Decision-Making**:  
  - Data-driven strategies for marketing, sales, and operations.  
- **Scalability and Adaptability**:  
  - A pipeline capable of handling growing datasets and complex analytics needs.  

---

### **Security Considerations**  
- Data encryption at rest and in transit.  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for secure access management.  
- Data masking for sensitive fields, ensuring compliance with GDPR.
